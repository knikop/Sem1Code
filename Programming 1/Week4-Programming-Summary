	#String
		-sequence of characters
		-zero or more characters
		-EX: String str = initial value

		#Class: has 2 parts: -data members
							-the methods
		#Length
		-Every string has a length that shows the amount
			of characters that it contains
		-".length()" gives you the length of the string
		-.length() will "return" you the length of a string,
			that is an int value
		
		#Addition
		-StringA + StringB  joins two strings together
		
		#Index
		-range of index [0,8]
		-spaces count as a position
		-Position
		>first:		0
		>second:	1
		>third:		2
		>fourth:	3
		>fifth:		4
		>sixth:		5
		>seventh:	6
		>eigth:		7
		>ninth:		8

		-".charAt()" method is used to extract a character from the string.
		-The index of the last element is .length() – 1

		-To find the index of something you use ".indexOf()"
		#Lowercase and Uppercase	
			-toLowerCase()
			-toUpperCase()

		-will switch all the letters in a string into Lower case or Upper case
		-if string contains symbols or anything that is not a letter
		-then the two methods keep it as the way it is

		#Escape Sequence
		->	\" a " character
		->	\' a ' character
 		->	\t a tab
 		->	\n a line breaker
 		->	\\ a \ character

 		#Format
 		-String: format()
 		-String.format() works almost the same as printf()
 		-printf() will print the string inside in the console
		-String.format() will return you the string

	#Character Class
		-has methods for char data type

		-Str.charAt(0) will extract the first character
 		-we have to use Character.toUpperCase() to convert it
  		-the data type will still be char.

		-Str.substring(1) will ignore the first character then extract the rest as a string.
		-use .toLowerCase() in the String class to convert to lowercase,
		-the data type will still be String

		-calculate char + String
		-converts char into String 
		-join the two Strings into one

		-Character.isWhiteSpace() 
				-(1) white space   ''
				-(2) line breaker  \n
				-(3)tab 		 '\t'

		#Math Class
				-Math.pow(a, b)		calculate ab
				-Math.sqrt(a)		calculate √𝑎
				-Math.min(a, b)		find the minimum value between a and b
				-Math.max(a, b)		find the maximum value between a and b
				-Math.abs(a)		calculate the absolute value of a: |a|
				-Math.round(a)		round the value a:  			3.1 -> 3.0		2.9 -> 3.0	
				-Math.ceil(a)		always bring the value up		3.1 -> 4.0		2.9 -> 3.0
				-Math.floor(a)		always bring the value down		3.1 -> 3.0		2.9 -> 2.0

				>Trig Function 
				-Math.sin(a)
				-Math.cos(a)
				-Math.tan(a)

				-Area of a Circle-------------> Math.PI * radius * radius
