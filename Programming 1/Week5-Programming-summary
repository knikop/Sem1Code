		#Method
			-Value-returning methods
				methods that return the data type. 
			 	methods return a value of a specific data type using the return statement
			-Void methods
				methods that do not have a return data type
				methods do not use a return statement return a value
			-first row - header -> all ports of a method
			-the statements - the body -> defines how the method behaves
			-public means outside of the class: everyone has access to the method
			-private means outside of the class: no one has access to the method
			-accessModifier(s) returnType methodName(formal parameter list) {
			statements
			}

			-Void Method
			- returns nothing
			- print methods = void methods
			-Boolean Method
			-Method to return a Boolean value
			
			ex: -isEven
				-isPositive
				-isValid

			-JavaDoc: write documentation for each method
			-@param for parameters
			-@return for return value
			-Each-method is an isolated universe: there will be no conflict bewteen methods
			-What happened in one universe will not affect the other universe
			
			ex:	-min(double num1, double num2)
			 	-max(double num1, double num2)
				-isEven(double num)
				-isOdd(double num)
				-isPositive(double num)
				-Isnegative(double num)

		#Boolean Operations
			-results -> Boolean values
			-Boolean operations : -> 2 levels
			#Level 1:
			->		>=
			->		<=
 			->		>
 			->		<
 			->		==		
 			->		!=
 			-all operations give results: true or false
 			-use = to compare to values
 			-use == to compare two strings
 			#Level 2: 
 			-advanced Boolean operations
 			->	And &&
 			->	Or ||
 			->	Not !
