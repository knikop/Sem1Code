	#Variable
		#Cant change data type after its declared, its value can be changed
			-int num;  	declare an int variable num
			-double num;  	ERROR, num is declared, and you cannot change its data type
			-datadouble num2;	CORRECT, num2 is not declared, and you can declare it.
			-boolean valid = false;  declare a Boolean variable valid, and initialize it to false
			-double sum = 0; 	declare a double variable sum, and initialize it to 0
			-sum = 3;  		change the value of variable sum

			#Some signs in java:
								"+"
								"-"
								"*"
								"/"
								"*"	

			#Counts in java:

				++count;			//			count++;		count = count + 1
				--timer;			//			timer--;		timer = timer - 1

				-Maybe
				-sometimes they are the same,
				-sometimes they are different

	#Important Actions for Coding
		
		#Java Actions: Scanner ; contains pre-defined methiods for our use to imput
			-Scanner = class
			-console = object
			-Class looks like a data type
					-import java.util.Scanner;
					-System.out.print(); 
					-System.out.println(); 
					-System.out.printf(); 
					-Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in); 
					-num = console.nextInt();
					-num = console.nextDouble();
					-next()
					-nextLine()
					-public static void main(String[] args) {}

		#Formating Code:
					-%d: int
					-%f: double
					-%c: char
					-%s: String
