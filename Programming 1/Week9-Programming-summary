	#Break and Continue
	  -“break” and “continue” only exists in a loop
	  -break will stop a loop completely
	  -continue will only stop the current iteration for a loop
	  ex:	-prints 0 and 2 while skips 1
	  		for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			if (i == 1)
			continue;
			System.out.print(i);
			} 
			-only prints 0
			for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			if (i == 1)
			break;
			System.out.print(i);
			} 
			-results can be very different depending on which one you use

			-Continue will make the loop continue
			-Break will literally break the loop, it will make it stop
			(break the entire loop and executes the code after the loop)
			$infinity loop = a loop that never ends
			
	#Unit Test
		QA: quality assurance
		Tester: Unit test
		TDD: test-driven development
		-> to enable test code push ctrl + F6
		-> if your code fails than you need to modify it so that it works
		->to do a unit test you have to:
		-1. write  the header and the doc of the method
		-2. list some of the possible inputs/outputs pairs
		-3. convert those parts in the last step into some testing codes
		-4. write the body of the method
		-5. test the method with the unit tests in step 3
		-if all the unit tests are passed, 
		then your code is robust and ready to go
		-if your code fails any of the unit tests,
		then you need to go back to modify your code in step 4
