		#Loop
			-Selection control structure ---> skip pieces of code
			-It cant go back to the code before
			-So we loop it----we make the program check the code until we tell it to stop

		#The loop control structure
			-go back to previous code
			-use it more than once 
			-3 different types of loops: -While loops
										 -do while loops
										 -for loops(which are the most used)
		#While Loop
			-basic loop structure
			-similar ti the "if"
			-while(condition){
					statement1;
					statement2;
				}
			-Like if,   while 1st checks the condition
			-If false, statement will be skipped
			-If true, statement used/executed
			-Then go back to while line and do it again
			-dont forget the = sign in the loop if you do then you wrote the loop wrong
			-use ( <= , >= , == ) for while loop
			-make the loop execute some #s then stop
			-when the condition is coded, it cannot be changed
			-can only change the value in the statement
			-will be changed from true to false 
			-use "i++" and/or "++i" in code
			-The loop would continue on forever if the index isnt changed
				(infinity loop)
			-if theres an infinity loop
						the code will continue forever
			-can also be used with a string

		#Do...While Loop
			-similar to While
			-execute the statements before the condition for one time
			-least used loop control structure 
			-used when you loop at least once
			-do
				statement;
			while(logical expression);
