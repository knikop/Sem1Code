 #Loop
 	#For Loop
	-i for iteration before loop
	-declare the counter
	-check the counter 
	-change the value of the counter: 
	 -> one before the loop
	  -> one in the ()
	   -> one in the loop body

	-3 things seperated by ; and not a ,
	ex: for (initial expression; logical expression; update expression)
	statement;
	-Initial expression: place you declare the counter (ex: i) and initialize it.
	-Logical expression: the regular condition you have in while and do while.
	-Update expression: the statement that you change the value of the counter like i++
	-Order is the same as the while loop
	-for loop can be written as a while loop

	#Break and Continue
	  -“break” and “continue” only exists in a loop
	  -break will stop a loop completely
	  -continue will only stop the current iteration for a loop
	  ex:	-prints 0 and 2 while skips 1
	  		for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			if (i == 1)
			continue;
			System.out.print(i);
			} 
			-only prints 0
			for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			if (i == 1)
			break;
			System.out.print(i);
			} 
			-results can be very different depending on which one you use
